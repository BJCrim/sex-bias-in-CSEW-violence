## README file for code archive for the paper:
## **Examining the sex bias of official estimates of violent crime in England and Wales** by Sylvia Walby and Brian Francis 

The SPSS syntax files are stored in the directory `SYNTAX`. These all have the extension .sps and can br opened in SPSS or in any text editor to view (OpenOffice Writer, WORD, wordpad).
There are worked examples used to get the weighted counts for specific years. We have supplied the worked code for the years 2009/10 and 2019/20. These are in the directories `2009-10` and `2019-20`.

Note that the data files are not supplied. These are available from the UK Data Service (UKDS).  You will need to register a project at the UKDS, then visit the Crime Survey landing page 
at http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-Series-200009, and add the required datasets to the project for each of the nineteen years of data. Finally you will need to download the datasets for each year in SPSS format, 
and extract them from the delivered `.zip` file. The list of data files required can be found in Section A of the *supplementary materials* file on the journal webpage.
