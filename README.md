The SPSS syntax files are stored in the branch `SYNTAX`. These all have the extension .sps and can br opened in SPSS or in any text editor to view (OpenOffice Writer, WORD, wordpad).
There is a worked example used to get the weighted counts. We have supplied the worked code for the year 2019/20. Theis is in the branch  `2019-20`.

Note that the data files are not supplied. These are available from the UK Data Service (UKDS).  You will need to register a project at the UKDS, then visit the Crime Survey landing page 
at http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-Series-200009, and add the required datasets to the project for each of the nineteen years of data. Finally you will need to download the datasets for each year in SPSS format, 
and extract them from the delivered `.zip` file. The list of data files required can be found in Section A of the *supplementary materials* file on the journal webpage.
